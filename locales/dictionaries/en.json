      },
      {
        "question": "Can you improve or redesign an existing website?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Do you provide support after the website is launched?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What technologies do you work with?",
        "answer": "I primarily work with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS on the front end. For the back end, I use Node.js (Fastify/Express) with Prisma, as well as modern platforms like Vercel, Supabase, or PlanetScale depending on your needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you handle everything if I’m not technical?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. I take care of the entire technical side: domain name, hosting, security, design integration, optimization, SEO, email setup, and more. You can focus solely on your business."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you also provide content, images, and SEO?",
