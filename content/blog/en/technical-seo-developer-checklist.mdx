![Technical SEO Checklist](/seo-technique-checklist.png)

We often talk about SEO from the content or marketing side. But **technical SEO** is the foundation. And as a developer, you're on the front line.

Here are the **10 technical points** I check on every project to guarantee a solid foundation for the SEO strategy.

### 1. ✅ Clean and Readable URLs

- No unnecessary parameters?
- Clear structure with hyphens (`/services/website-creation`)
- Dynamic slug properly generated in Next.js or Laravel?

### 2. ✅ `<title>` and `meta description` Tags

- Dynamically generated?
- Include the right keywords?
- No duplication between pages?

👉 On Next.js 13+, you can use `metadata.ts` to do this properly.

### 3. ✅ Well-Hierarchized Hn Tags

- Only one `<h1>` per page
- Logical structure: h1 → h2 → h3
- No empty or skipped heading (h2 directly after h4)

### 4. ✅ Automatically Generated Sitemap.xml

- Contains all important pages
- Updated with each build?
- Includes update dates?

👉 Useful tools: `next-sitemap`, `laravel-sitemap`

### 5. ✅ Well-Configured robots.txt

- Blocks private pages (e.g., `/admin`)
- Allows crawling of assets and public pages
- Indicates sitemap URL

### 6. ✅ Performance (Core Web Vitals)

- **LCP** < 2.5s?
- **CLS** < 0.1?
- **FID** or INP fast?

👉 Use Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, or WebPageTest.org

### 7. ✅ Optimized Image Loading

- Lazy loading activated?
- WebP or modern formats?
- `alt` tags properly filled?

### 8. ✅ Internal and External Links

- Consistent internal links between pages?
- `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute on external links?
- No broken links (404)?

### 9. ✅ Canonical Tags

- Useful for pages with similar content
- Managed dynamically if potential duplication

### 10. ✅ Structured Data (schema.org)

- Organization, product, article, FAQ...
- Adds context to your pages
- Increases chances of rich results

👉 Example (JSON-LD) to include in the `<head>`:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Mohamad Al-Khatib",
  "url": "https://mk-web.fr"
}
```

### 📈 Bonus: Testing Tools

- Google Search Console
- Lighthouse / PageSpeed
- Screaming Frog SEO Spider
- Ahrefs / SEMrush / Moz

### 🎯 Conclusion

By applying this technical SEO checklist to all your projects, you:

- Facilitate Google indexing
- Boost performance from the start
- Prepare a solid SEO foundation for your client or your own site
