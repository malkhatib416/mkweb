You've finished your website, refined the design, and written your content…
it's finally time to publish. But what's next? Welcome to the
world of **SEO** — Search Engine Optimization.

This simplified guide will help you understand the basics of SEO and
give you the keys to effectively position your site in search results.

### 🎯 Key Points

- SEO aims to improve your site's visibility and attract organic (non-paid) traffic.
- It includes: keyword research, on-page, off-page, and technical SEO.
- It's a long-term effort that requires monitoring your performance, staying updated, and regularly optimizing your content.

### 🔍 What is SEO?

It's a set of techniques that allow your site to appear higher
in search engine results like Google. The goal: capture
maximum qualified traffic, for free.

Search engines evaluate three main criteria:

- Content relevance
- Site credibility
- User experience (speed, mobile accessibility…)

### 📈 Why is SEO Important?

- Generate free and sustainable traffic
- Become an authority in your field
- Offer an optimal user experience
- Stay ahead of competitors

### 🔑 Keyword Research: The Foundation of SEO

Keywords are the expressions your users type on Google.
Use tools like Originality.ai, Ahrefs, or SEMrush to:

- Identify relevant keywords
- Analyze search intent (informational, transactional, etc.)
- Target long-tail keywords that are more specific and less competitive

### 🧱 On-Page SEO: Optimize Your Content

- **Titles & Meta-descriptions**: include main keywords from the start
- **URL Structure**: clear, short, with hyphens
- **H1, H2, H3 Tags**: to organize content
- **Internal Links**: to improve navigation
- **Image Optimization**: compression and ALT tags
- **Responsive Design**: essential for mobile

### 🔗 Off-Page SEO: Strengthen Your Authority

Off-page SEO relies on backlinks — links from other credible sites:

- Write guest articles
- Collaborate with influencers or journalists
- Create unique, high-value content

*Beware of dubious link techniques that violate Google's rules.*

### ⚙️ Technical SEO: Optimize Performance

- Loading speed: Google favors fast sites
- XML Sitemap: to facilitate indexing
- Google Search Console: to detect errors

### 📊 Tracking & Analysis

SEO is a continuous process. Use these tools:

- Google Analytics: traffic, bounce rate
- Search Console: indexing errors
- Originality.ai: optimization scores
- Ahrefs / SEMrush / Moz: keyword and backlink tracking

Important metrics to track:

- Organic traffic
- Keyword rankings
- Click-through rate (CTR)
- Bounce rate
- Domain Authority (DA)

### 🚀 Ready to Get Started?

SEO is a long-term investment. Results aren't
immediate, but consistent efforts pay off.

Stay informed, optimize your content, and prioritize quality over quantity.
