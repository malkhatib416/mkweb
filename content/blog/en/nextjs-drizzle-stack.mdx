![Next.js + Drizzle ORM Stack](/nextjs-drizzle.png)

Today, building a performant, fast, and scalable web application is no longer just about "doing React". As a freelance JavaScript developer, I've tested many tools, frameworks, and ORMs across projects. But for several months, one combination has naturally established itself in my workflow: **Next.js 15 + Drizzle ORM**.

In this article, I'll explain why this stack allows me to deliver modern, robust applications, and why it's a real plus for my clients.

### 🚀 Next.js 15: More Than Just a React Framework

Next.js has become a complete fullstack framework. Since version 13, and even more with 15, it offers:

- **App Router**: ultra-clear modular architecture
- **Server & Client components**: optimized rendering
- **Edge rendering & streaming**: maximum performance
- **Nested layouts**: for complex and responsive interfaces
- **Native SEO**: fine management with the `metadata.ts` API

With Next.js, I can deploy a performant app from day one, without recoding the entire backend architecture. It's a real time saver.

### 🧩 Drizzle ORM: Native Typing, Clear Queries, Simplicity

I've long used Prisma, Knex, Sequelize… but Drizzle ORM changed my vision:

- **Native TypeScript typing**, no client generation
- **SQL-like syntax**, simple and readable
- **Very powerful .query API** to structure queries
- **No black magic**: everything is explicit

```typescript
const result = await db.query.users.findMany({
  where: (u, { eq }) => eq(u.email, 'client@example.com'),
});
```

The typing is strict but comfortable, productivity is excellent, and above all: **the code is maintainable**.

### 🔧 The Power of the Next.js + Drizzle Combination

These two tools integrate perfectly in a monorepo architecture:

- End-to-end TypeScript typing
- Backend and frontend in the same repo
- Performance + structure + development speed
- Very easy API Routes or Server Actions implementation

I can thus develop a complete, optimized, and readable fullstack application without sacrificing scalability or code quality.

### 🧪 Real Case: AlertJO.fr

For [AlertJO.fr](https://alertjo.fr), I used this stack to create an app that:

- Scrapes official gazette PDFs
- Extracts names and case numbers
- Allows quick search by number
- Sends email notifications on match

Result: a lightweight, fast, maintainable app, with well-structured SEO to attract the right users.

### 🎯 Why It's an Advantage for My Clients

- Modern and scalable apps
- Fast and smooth rendering
- Readable, structured, and typed code
- Time savings in future developments

My goal as a freelancer isn't just to write code. It's to deliver reliable, performant, maintainable, and well-designed technical solutions.
