![Next.js Monorepo Structure](/nextjs-monorepo.png)

When developing a Next.js application that will grow over time — with multiple modules, backends, shared components — a monorepo architecture quickly becomes a necessity. After several projects, I'm sharing here my best practices for structuring a Next.js project in a clean, maintainable, and scalable monorepo.

### 📦 Why Switch to Monorepo?

- **Centralize frontend, API, shared libraries**
- **Reduce code duplication** (types, business logic)
- **Simplify updates** across all modules
- **Better manage permissions / CI / tests**

A well-structured monorepo also allows multiple people to work without overwriting other modules.

### 🧰 Recommended Tools

- **Turborepo** (or Nx) for cached builds
- **pnpm** with workspaces for fast dependency resolution
- **TypeScript** with `projectReferences`
- **ESLint + Prettier** configured at root level

### 📁 Basic Structure of a Next.js Monorepo

```
my-app/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/         → main Next.js app
│   └── admin/       → admin interface
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/          → shared components (design system)
│   ├── config/      → Tailwind, ESLint config, etc.
│   └── db/          → ORM, Drizzle schemas, DB helpers
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── turbo.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Each sub-project can have its own dependencies while accessing common packages via `workspaces`.

### 🔄 Usage Example: Shared Components

The `packages/ui` folder contains components like `<Button />`, `<Card />`, `<Layout />`, all written in TypeScript and styled with Tailwind.

```tsx
// packages/ui/button.tsx
export function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button className="rounded-xl px-4 py-2 bg-orange-500 text-white">
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Then, you import it from `apps/web`:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@ui/button';
```

### 🧪 Tests and Shared Typing

In `packages/types`, I place all my shared types between frontend, backend, and API. This allows strict typing, especially for data retrieved with Drizzle ORM.

For tests, each app can embed its own Jest/Vitest, or we can share helpers in `packages/test-utils`.

### 🚀 Deployment and CI/CD

- **Vercel** natively supports Turborepo
- **Github Actions** or **Husky** to validate PRs
- Deployment per app (web, admin…) targeting only what changed

### 🎯 What a Well-Structured Monorepo Changes for My Clients

- Easier maintenance, even with multiple apps
- Single source of truth for types, components, functions
- Visual and technical consistency across the entire product
- Real scalability in the long term
