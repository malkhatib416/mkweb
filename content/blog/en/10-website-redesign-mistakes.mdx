![Common Redesign Mistakes](/erreurs-refonte.png)

Website redesign is a strategic project, but it's easy to fall into certain traps. To help you conduct a smooth redesign, here are the **10 most common mistakes** and how to avoid them.

### 1. Neglecting SEO Audit Before Redesign

Without a prior SEO audit, you risk losing your performing keywords, your backlinks, and your search result rankings. To avoid this:

- Conduct a complete audit of current SEO (high-traffic pages, backlinks, keyword positioning).
- Export the URL structure and note their performance.
- Plan a `301` redirect for each modified URL to preserve "SEO juice".

### 2. Forgetting to Backup and Version Control

Without backup, a technical error can erase your current site. Without version control, you won't be able to roll back. To avoid these risks:

- Set up a regular backup system (files, database, configurations).
- Use Git to version the code and create a dedicated branch for the redesign.
- Test your backup restoration before going live.

### 3. Not Establishing Clear and Measurable Objectives

Without objectives (reducing load time, improving conversion rate, increasing organic traffic…), you won't be able to measure the redesign's success. Remember to:

- Define precise KPIs (load time, bounce rate, keyword positioning).
- Document baseline values before the redesign (benchmarks).
- Set SMART objectives (example: "reduce load time by 20% within 3 months").

### 4. Modifying URL Structure Without Redirection Plan

Bulldozing the URL structure = guaranteed 404s for visitors and Google. To avoid this:

- List all existing URLs via a crawler (Screaming Frog, etc.).
- Establish a mapping of old ➡ new URLs and configure 301 redirects.
- Verify post-launch that no 404s appear and redirects work.

### 5. Ignoring Impact on Internal Linking and External Links

URL changes break your internal links and backlinks. To limit damage:

- Identify the most linked pages (internal linking audit).
- Update internal links after redesign.
- Notify your partners to update external links, or configure 301s as a last resort.

### 6. Neglecting Performance (Load Speed)

A slow site drives away visitors and penalizes your SEO. To maintain fluidity:

- Measure Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) before and after redesign.
- Optimize images (compression, WebP, lazy loading).
- Combine and minify CSS/JS, defer third-party script loading.
- Activate a cache system (Redis, CDN, CMS cache plugins).

### 7. Failing to Test on Different Browsers and Devices

A site that works on Chrome desktop isn't necessarily functional on Firefox or mobile Safari. To avoid surprises:

- Define the list of target browsers and versions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).
- Use BrowserStack or LambdaTest for automated cross-browser testing.
- Perform manual tests on smartphones and tablets (iOS, Android).
- Fix CSS prefixes and add necessary polyfills for modern JS.

### 8. Underestimating User Experience (UX) Importance

Focusing only on technology or aesthetic design without putting yourself in the user's shoes can generate a confusing interface. Remember to:

- Conduct user tests on an interactive mockup.
- Design a logical architecture via card sorting.
- Simplify conversion paths (visible CTAs, short forms).
- Think responsive from conception (touch targets, sufficient clickable area).

### 9. Not Involving All Stakeholders

Involving only the project manager or developers without consulting marketing, sales, or support carries the risk of not meeting business needs. To avoid misunderstandings:

- Organize framing workshops with all concerned teams.
- Write detailed specifications (user stories, functional specifications).
- Validate wireframes/graphics with teams before development.
- Plan training for new back-offices or implemented tools.

### 10. Forgetting Post-Launch Monitoring and Continuous Maintenance

Launching the site is good; evolving and protecting it is essential. For sustainable maintenance:

- Activate Google Analytics, Search Console, and a Core Web Vitals monitoring tool.
- Schedule regular performance tests (PageSpeed, GTmetrix).
- Set up a maintenance contract (CMS/plugin updates, offsite backups).
- Collect user feedback via a feedback form.
- Analyze lead evolution and adjust conversion funnel if necessary (A/B testing).

By avoiding these ten mistakes, you maximize your chances of achieving a successful, performant redesign aligned with your business objectives.
